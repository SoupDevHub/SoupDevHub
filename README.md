# Hi

### I'm Soup, a (mainly) C# developer. This is the place I throw all of my trash projects, things I need help with, and things I think should be open source.

### FAQ:

-   What are you currently working on? - I'm currently working on a few closed source games using the Unity game engine, but I edit [RoboSoup](https://github.com/SoupDevHub/RoboSoup "Bot that does things for discord.") sometmes too.
-   What do you do other then that? - I play Minecraft more than any sane person would.
